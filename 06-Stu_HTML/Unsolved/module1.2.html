  <p>My name is Nic Diaz, and I'm a UCF alumni enrolled in coding Bootcamp. After experiencing many different industries, I've found myself in the tech industry for 10 months now. As I work with software engineers to make sure they are using my company's software well, I've become more and more interested in what software developers do on a daily basis. I look forward to becoming more technical, and realizing my goal of becoming a junior developer.</p>
